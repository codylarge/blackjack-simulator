### Blackjack 3rd base simulator
Simulates the 3rd base position in blackjack to decide whether or not the person in that position's decision has any real impact on the game (spoiler alert: they dont)

This is my first real c++ project <br>
todo: get more stats, find out which dealer hand gives 3rd base player the most responsibility, the least?
